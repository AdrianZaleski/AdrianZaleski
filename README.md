<h2>Hello there! My name is AdrianZaleski</h2>

I am a beginner programmer in Python, but also I have learned basics of Django, SQL, HTML5, CSS. 
I had previously contact with C++, but at the studies I prefered 3D modeling and reverse engineering. During my working experience I had contact with Python, and I wanted to gain knowladge how to use it. 
 

<h3>Software Development Academy Course</h3>
I have the pleasure to participate in the "Python from Basics" course organized by the Software Development Academy. I am at the end of the course but still I have many things to learn. 


<h4>Maybe something different than programming?</h4>
I’m interested in Reverse Engineering, 3D Printing, WW2 History, Reenactment, vintage motorization.  
Also I love watching anime, participate in role playing games and occasionally play guitar.
